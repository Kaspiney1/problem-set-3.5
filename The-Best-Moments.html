    <p>There are many moments in the history of the sport that just make people think back and say hey, that was a really good
      time, I wish that could happen again. This is present in almost every sport and it is included in Soccer to. A moment like
      Iceland beating England in the Euro round of 16. To cut it short, the sport is filled with some great memories and I am here
      to talk about them.

        <h3>Messi's 91 Goal Year</h3>
        <li>Back in 2011, Messi had the best year of soccer of any player in history. He scored an astonishing 91 goals in a calendar
          year. The previous record was held by Gerd Muller at 85. If anything, this is a record that will hold for a very long time.
        </li>
        <h3>2018 World Cup</h3>
        <li>Although this just happened a few months ago, there is no denying that it was one of the most entertaining World Cups that
          we have ever seen. So many teams that you would never expect made it far into the tournament. Croatia having a dream run through
          the tournament to get to the finals. France did ultimately come out winners in a very entertaining month of Soccer.
        </li>
        <h3>2004 Euros</h3>
        <li>This Euro featured one of the most surprising finishes of any tournament in history. It finished with Greece beating
          a dominant Portugal team to win the Euros. Greece were supposed to be knocked out early on but went on to win. This came
          to be one of the biggest upsets for a major tournament final in history.
        </li>
        <h3>Barcelona Comeback Against PSG</h3>
        <li>What is now known as the greatest comeback in history, Barcelona came back from a 4-0 loss in the first leg to win 6-1
          at home and move on to the next round. Prior to this game, no team has ever come back from a 4-0 loss to win the next game
          and move on. The closest was a 4-1 loss and then a 3-0 win to move on. As a Barca fan, this is definitely a moment that I
          would love to relive.
