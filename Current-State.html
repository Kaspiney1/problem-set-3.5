    <p>Soccer currently has its ups and downs. To begin with, Soccer is one of the most popular sports
       in the world. Some of the best players in history are playing right now. With every good thing,
       comes a problem. The organizations that are linked with the sport like FIFA and UEFA can at
       times become very corrupt. Whether this comes in the form of taking money to favor one team
       in a competition or favoring a player in a voting process. For this page, we will go more in
       depth on the problems and benefits for the current state of Soccer.
     <h2>The Benefits</h2>
     <p>There are a lot of positives when it comes to liking Soccer in todays world. You have a wide variety of teams and leagues or
       tournaments to pay attention to and you can follow which ever one you really want. Whether it is the Champions League, Premier League
       or even the World Cup, you do not really run out of options to choose from. Another benefit Soccer has to offer is its' popularity.
       Since it is so popular, this allows for tickets to games to be a lot cheaper since there would be a lot of people attending these
       games compared to a lot less for a sport like Baseball. Finally, the last benefit would be the amount of games being played.
       As a result, there are always games or highlights to watch from multiple different leagues that are all equally entertaining
       instead of the weekly wait.

       <h2>The Downsides</h2>
       <p>Just because there are a lot of upsides to the Current State of Soccer, there are still a lot of downsides to it. For example,
         the bribery that goes on in the sport. The corporation, FIFA, is known to be a pretty corrupt company. To be saying that it is not
         corrupt would be lying way to much. Many teams nowadays attempt to pay the referees to tilt a game into their favor. Not every
         referee takes this but they still exist. Some other downsides would be accidents that the referees make. This is unavoidable in a lot of ways
         as obviously not every referee is perfect at what he does. Sometimes, a ref would accidently make a call that goes against your team
         but you just have to deal with it. The referee tries his best to really get every call right. This would lead to VAR being introduced.
         Personally, I feel that VAR is not needed as it ruins some of the sneaky parts of the sport like diving. It is against the rules but it
         is nice to see someone get away with it. Otherwise, there is nothing really bad about the sport. Not much to fix, is there?
